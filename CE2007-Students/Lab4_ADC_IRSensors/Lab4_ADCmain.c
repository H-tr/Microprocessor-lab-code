// Lab15_ADCmain.c
// Runs on MSP432
// Test the operation of the GP2Y0A21YK0F infrared distance
// sensors by repeatedly taking measurements.  Either
// perform statistical analysis of the data, stream data
// directly from all three channels, or stream calibrated
// measurements from all three channels.  In this case, the
// results are sent through the UART to a computer running
// TExaSdisplay or another terminal program.
